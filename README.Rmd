`TempeCell_AllData.xlsx` contains all of the data used in analyses as well as a README tab explaining data types and units. The R Markdown files are configured to read directly from this master spreadsheet on the user's desktop. 

Each RMarkdown file regenerates all results and figures used in the manuscript. The `.md` files in this repo show formatted code output. The `.Rmd` files can be downloaded to run and edit on your lcoal machine. 

`DO.md` shows data processing for DO data. 
`FeMn.md` shows data processing for Fe and Mn reduction. 
`CO2_Efflux.md` shows data processing for CO2 flux data.
`Pore_Volume.md` shows data processing for pore volume analysis.
`Other_Analyses.md` shows data processing for ancillary data such as dissolved organic carbon, pH, etc.
