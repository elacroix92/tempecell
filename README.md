`TempeCell_AllData.xlsx` contains all of the data used in analyses as
well as a README tab explaining data types and units. The R Markdown
files are configured to read directly from this master spreadsheet on
the user’s desktop.

Each RMarkdown file regenerates all results and figures used in the
manuscript. The `.md` files in this repo show formatted code output. The
`.Rmd` files can be downloaded to run and edit on your local machine.

`DO.md` shows data processing for DO data. `FeMn.md` shows data
processing for Fe and Mn reduction. `CO2_Efflux.md` shows data
processing for CO2 flux data. `Pore_Volume.md` shows data processing for
pore volume analysis. `Other_Analyses.md` shows data processing for
ancillary data such as dissolved organic carbon, pH, etc.
